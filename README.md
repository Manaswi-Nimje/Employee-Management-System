## 📖 About

**Student ERP** is a single-page application built with Angular's standalone component architecture. It gives an admin a simple dashboard to manage student records — no page reloads, no clutter, just a sidebar, a few forms, and instant search.

It's built as a learning/portfolio project to demonstrate real-world Angular concepts: routing with nested/child routes, reactive forms with validation, services + `HttpClient`, and a mock REST backend powered by `json-server`.

## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 📊 **Dashboard Layout** | Sidebar navigation with a collapsible dropdown menu and an admin header panel |
| 📋 **Student List** | Fetches and displays all students from the API in a live table |
| ➕ **Add Student** | Reactive form (with validation) to add new students — ID, name, course, marks, admission date |
| 👤 **Profile Lookup** | Search a student by **ID or name**, or open a profile directly via `/profile/:id` |
| 🔗 **Nested Routing** | `dashboard/students` and `dashboard/add-student` as child routes inside the dashboard shell |
| 🎨 **Font Awesome Icons** | Integrated icon set for a polished UI |
| ⚡ **Standalone Components** | No `NgModules` — built entirely with Angular's modern standalone API |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI — `npm install -g @angular/cli` (optional, `npx ng` also works)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manaswi-Nimje/Employee-Management-System.git
cd Employee-Management-System
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the mock API server

The app talks to a REST API at `http://localhost:4500/students`, served from `students.json` via `json-server`:

```bash
npx json-server --watch students.json --port 4500
```

> Keep this terminal running — it's your "backend" for the whole app.

### 4. Start the Angular dev server

In a **second terminal**:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open your browser at **[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)** 🎉

The app will auto-reload whenever you edit a source file.

## 🧭 Routes

| Path | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | — | Redirects to `/dashboard` |

| `GET` | `/students` | Returns the full list of students |
| `POST` | `/students` | Adds a new student record |

**Student object shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "studname": "Aarav Sharma",
  "course": "Computer Science",
  "marks": 92.45,
  "admissionDate": "2024-01-15"
}
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Runs unit tests via **Vitest**.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Edit / delete student records
- [ ] Replace `json-server` with a real backend (Node/Express or Spring Boot)
- [ ] Add authentication for the admin panel
- [ ] Client-side sorting & filtering on the student list
- [ ] Charts on the dashboard (attendance, marks distribution, etc.)
